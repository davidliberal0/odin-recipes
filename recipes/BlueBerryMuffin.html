    <h4>Not too sweet and delightful most Blue Berry Muffins</h4>
    <p>
      These muffins are huge and tastey with a sugary crumb topping. I usually
      double the recipe to feed the entire family. I recommend to fill the
      muffin cups to the top edge for a much larger generously sized deli style
      muffin. You can even throw <strong>EXTRA</strong> blueberries in there as
      well!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1&frac12; cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>&frac34; cup white sugar</li>
      <li>&frac12; teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>&frac13; cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>&frac13; cup milk, or more as needed</li>
      <li>1 cup of fresh blueberries</li>
      <li>&frac13; cup all-pupose flour</li>
      <li>&frac14; cup butter, cubed</li>
      <li>1&frac12; teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or
        line with muffin liners.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine 1 1/2 cups flour, 3/4 cup sugar, salt and baking powder. Place
        vegetable oil into a 1 cup measuring cup; add the egg and add enough
        milk to reach the 1-cup mark.
      </li>
      <li>Mix this with flour mixture. Fold in blueberries.</li>
      <li>
        Fill muffin cups right to the top, and sprinkle with crumb topping
        mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        To Make Crumb Topping: Mix together 1/2 cup sugar, 1/3 cup flour, 1/4
        cup butter, and 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon. Mix with fork, and sprinkle
        over muffins before baking.
      </li>
      <li>Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until done.</li>
    </ol>
