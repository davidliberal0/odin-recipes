    <h4>Not too sweet and delightful most Blue Berry Muffins</h4>
    <p>
      These muffins are huge and tastey with a sugary crumb topping. I usually
      double the recipe to feed the entire family. I recommend to fill the
      muffin cups to the top edge for a much larger generously sized deli style
      muffin. You can even throw <strong>EXTRA</strong> blueberries in there as
      well!
